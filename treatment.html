                <p>Ayurvedic treatments are mainly focussed on detoxification of all body systems (shodhana karma or Panchakarma). Panchakarma is cleansing of the body according to Ayurveda. Panchakarma is claimed to eliminate the vitiated Doshas from the body. This is a set of five (pancha = five in sanskrit) procedures. They are Vamana, Virechana, Vasthi, Nasya and Rakthamoksha.
                A person who has to take Panchakarma treatments has to go through the pre-procedures or Poorvakarma which includes oleation and sudation</p>
